# Parts needed and schematics:
  * [Wemos D1 mini microcontroller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Makerfire-NodeMcu-Development-ESP8266-Compatible/dp/B071S8MWTY/).
  * [SparkFun MAX3232 Transceiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11189).
  * US2000B: Cable with RJ10 connector (some RJ10 cables have only two wires, make sure to buy one that has all four wires present).
  * US2000C or US5000: Cable with RJ45 connector (see below for more details).
  * Capacitors C1: 10uF, C2: 0.1uF (this is not strictly required, but recommended as Wemos D1 can have large current spikes).

# US2000C/US3000C/US5000 notes:
This battery uses RJ45 cable instead of RJ10. Schematics is the same only plug differs:
  * RJ45 Pin 3 (white-green) = R1IN
  * RJ45 Pin 6 (green)       = T1OUT
  * RJ45 Pin 8 (brown)       = GND

## Home Assistant MQTT Discovery Sensors

When `ENABLE_MQTT` is defined and the firmware connects successfully to your MQTT broker, the following sensors will appear in Home Assistant via **MQTT Autodiscovery**.


---

### Global Sensors

These sensors describe the overall battery stack:

1. **SoC**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech Battery SoC`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>soc`  
   - **Unit**: `%`  
   - **device_class**: `battery`  
   - **Description**: Total State of Charge (%) for the battery stack.

2. **temp**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech Temperature`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>temp`  
   - **Unit**: `°C`  
   - **device_class**: `temperature`  
   - **Description**: Overall battery temperature (converted internally from millidegrees).

3. **currentDC**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech Battery Current`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>currentDC`  
   - **Unit**: `mA`  
   - **device_class**: `current`  
   - **Description**: Summed DC current in milliamps (positive = charging, negative = discharging).

4. **powerDC**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech DC Power`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>getPowerDC`  
   - **Unit**: `W`  
   - **device_class**: `power`  
   - **Description**: Approximate DC power in watts (calculated from voltage and current).

5. **powerIN**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech Power IN`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>powerIN`  
   - **Unit**: `W`  
   - **device_class**: `power`  
   - **Description**: Instantaneous power (W) flowing into the battery (charging).

6. **powerOUT**  
   - **HA Name**: `Pylontech Power OUT`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT>powerOUT`  
   - **Unit**: `W`  
   - **device_class**: `power`  
   - **Description**: Instantaneous power (W) flowing out of the battery (discharging).

---

### Per-Battery Sensors

Each physical battery is indexed by `ix` (0 to `MAX_PYLON_BATTERIES-1`). For each one, the firmware creates four additional sensors:

1. **Charging**  
   - **HA Name**: `Battery ix Charging`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/charging`  
   - **Unit**: *(none)* — returns `0` or `1`  
   - **Description**: Indicates whether this battery is charging (`1`) or not (`0`).

2. **Discharging**  
   - **HA Name**: `Battery ix Discharging`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/discharging`  
   - **Unit**: *(none)* — returns `0` or `1`  
   - **Description**: Indicates if the battery is discharging (`1`) or not (`0`).

3. **Idle**  
   - **HA Name**: `Battery ix Idle`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/idle`  
   - **Unit**: *(none)* — returns `0` or `1`  
   - **Description**: Indicates if this battery is in “Idle” state (`1`) or not (`0`).

4. **State**  
   - **HA Name**: `Battery ix State`  
   - **MQTT Topic**: `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/state`  
   - **Unit**: *(none)*  
   - **Values**: `Idle`, `Charging`, `Discharging`, or `Unknown`  
   - **Description**: A textual status for the single battery.

Additionally, the firmware publishes these numeric values for each battery (not auto-discovered):

- `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/voltage` (voltage in V)  
- `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/current` (current in A)  
- `<MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT><ix>/soc` (SoC %)

---

### Other Published Data

A few more values are published but not automatically discovered:

- **`battery_count`** — number of detected batteries  
- **`base_state`** — overall stack state (`"Charge"`, `"Dischg"`, `"Idle"`, etc.)  
- **`is_normal`** — `1` if all batteries are normal, otherwise `0`  
- **`estPowerAC`** — approximate AC-side power in W (inverter losses considered)

You can manually create MQTT sensors in Home Assistant to track these additional topics.

---

## Home Assistant Energy Integration

If you want to display **kWh** (cumulative energy) in Home Assistant’s Energy dashboard, you need sensors of type “energy” instead of “power.” By default, this firmware publishes instantaneous power in watts (`W`), which Home Assistant does not directly include in the Energy panel. To solve this, you can use Home Assistant’s **integration** platform to convert power (W) into energy (kWh).

Below is an example of how to create two custom sensors—one for battery **in** energy (charging) and one for battery **out** energy (discharging)—which you can then select in Home Assistant’s Energy configuration.

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.pylontechbattery_pylontech_power_in
    name: "Pylontech Battery Energy In"
    unit_prefix: k
    round: 2
    method: left

  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.pylontechbattery_pylontech_power_out
    name: "Pylontech Battery Energy Out"
    unit_prefix: k
    round: 2
    method: left
```

> **Notes**:
> - **`source`** must match the *power sensor* name in watts that the firmware publishes, as seen in Home Assistant’s Developer Tools → States (e.g., `sensor.pylontechbattery_pylontech_power_in`).
> - **`unit_prefix: k`** converts watt-hours (Wh) to kilowatt-hours (kWh).
> - **`round: 2`** sets the number of decimal places.
> - **`method: left`** is one of the integration methods (other options: `trapezoidal`, etc.).

### Using in the Energy Dashboard

1. **Restart** Home Assistant after adding the above configuration.  
2. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services** or directly **Settings → Energy** (depending on your HA version).  
3. In **Settings → Energy**, add a new energy source or battery entry:
   - Select the newly created sensor, e.g., `sensor.pylontech_battery_energy_in` or `sensor.pylontech_battery_energy_out`.
4. Home Assistant will begin accumulating data for these sensors in kilowatt-hours over time. It may take some minutes or hours to populate graphs and statistics in the Energy dashboard.

With this approach, you keep your firmware simple (publishing power in watts) and let Home Assistant handle the accumulation into kWh. Once you have these “Energy” sensors, you can fully utilize Home Assistant’s Energy dashboard to monitor charging and discharging over time.
